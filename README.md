hpg-libs
========

C libraries for the High Performance Genomics (HPG) project:

* common-libs: Data structures and 3rd libraries used by the rest of our libraries and applications
* bioinfo-libs: Bioinformatics file formats and genome sequence aligners
* math: Statistics and algebra functions


Each library must be compiled independently using SCons. A static library file (.a) will be generated as a result in each folder.
